# 🎯 CTF Writeups

Welcome to my personal archive of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge writeups. While this is just the start, this repository will contain solutions and walkthroughs for challenges from various CTF platforms and events, including:

- 🧠 PicoCTF  
- 🧪 TryHackMe
- 🔐 MetaCTF
- 🚩 Collegiate/National CTFs (like DoE CyberForce)

Each writeup includes my methodology, tools used, and key takeaways — written to help myself and others learn and grow in cybersecurity.
